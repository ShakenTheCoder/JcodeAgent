      "BEGINNER_GUIDE.md": "# Complete Beginner's Guide to JCode\n\n> **Never coded before? No problem!** This guide will walk you through everything you need to get JCode running on your computer, step by step.\n\n## What is JCode?\n\nJCode is like having a team of AI programmers on your computer. You describe what you want to build in plain English, and it creates the code for you \u2014 completely free, completely private, running on your own machine.\n\n**No coding knowledge required. No cloud services. No subscriptions.**\n\n---\n\n## \u26a1 One-Command Install (Recommended)\n\nThe fastest way to get started \u2014 **one line installs everything**:\n\n### Mac / Linux\n\nOpen Terminal and paste:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShakenTheCoder/JcodeAgent/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nOpen PowerShell (right-click Start \u2192 \"Windows PowerShell\") and paste:\n\n```powershell\niwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShakenTheCoder/JcodeAgent/main/install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\n**That's it!** The installer automatically:\n- \u2705 Installs Python (if you don't have it)\n- \u2705 Installs Ollama (if you don't have it)\n- \u2705 Downloads the AI models (if you don't have them)\n- \u2705 Downloads JCode\n- \u2705 Sets everything up and adds `jcode` to your PATH\n\nAfter it finishes, just type `jcode` and start building!\n\n> **Want to understand what's happening?** The manual steps below explain everything the installer does automatically.\n\n---\n\n## Manual Install (Step by Step)\n\nIf you prefer to install things yourself, or the one-liner didn't work, follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Install Python (The Language JCode Speaks)\n\n### For Mac Users\n\n1. **Open Terminal** (it's an app on your Mac):\n   - Press `Command + Space`\n   - Type \"Terminal\"\n   - Press Enter\n\n2. **Install Homebrew** (a tool that makes installing things easier):\n   ```bash\n   /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n   ```\n   - Paste that line into Terminal and press Enter\n   - It will ask for your password (the same one you use to unlock your Mac)\n   - Wait 5-10 minutes for it to finish\n\n3. **Install Python**:\n   ```bash\n   brew install python@3.12\n   ```\n   - Wait for it to finish (2-3 minutes)\n\n4. **Verify Python is installed**:\n   ```bash\n   python3 --version\n   ```\n   - You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`\n\n### For Windows Users\n\n1. **Download Python**:\n   - Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/\n   - Click the big yellow button \"Download Python 3.12.x\"\n   - Run the downloaded file\n\n2. **During installation**:\n   - \u2705 **IMPORTANT**: Check the box that says \"Add Python to PATH\"\n   - Click \"Install Now\"\n   - Wait for it to finish\n\n3. **Verify Python is installed**:\n   - Press `Windows Key + R`\n   - Type `cmd` and press Enter\n   - Type: `python --version`\n   - You should see `Python 3.12.x`\n\n### For Linux Users\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-venv python3-pip\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Install Ollama (The AI Brain)\n\nOllama is the free, local AI that powers JCode. It runs on your computer \u2014 no internet needed after setup.\n\n### For Mac Users\n\n1. Go to https://ollama.ai/download\n2. Click \"Download for macOS\"\n3. Open the downloaded file and drag Ollama to your Applications folder\n4. Open Ollama from Applications (it will add an icon to your menu bar)\n\n### For Windows Users\n\n1. Go to https://ollama.ai/download\n2. Click \"Download for Windows\"\n3. Run the installer\n4. Ollama will start automatically (look for the llama icon in your system tray)\n\n### For Linux Users\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Download the AI Models\n\nThese are the \"brains\" JCode uses. You only need to do this once.\n\n### Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows)\n\nType these two commands:\n\n```bash\nollama pull deepseek-r1:14b\n```\n\nWait for it to finish (10-15 minutes, downloads ~8 GB).\n\nThen:\n\n```bash\nollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b\n```\n\nWait for this one too (10-15 minutes, downloads ~8 GB).\n\n**What's happening?** You're downloading two specialized AI models:\n- **deepseek-r1** \u2014 the \"architect\" that plans your project\n- **qwen2.5-coder** \u2014 the \"programmer\" that writes the code\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Download JCode\n\n### Option A: Download as ZIP (Easiest)\n\n1. Go to wherever JCode is hosted (e.g., GitHub)\n2. Click the green \"Code\" button\n3. Click \"Download ZIP\"\n4. Unzip the file (double-click it)\n5. Move the `JcodeAgent` folder to your Desktop\n\n### Option B: Using Git (If You Have It)\n\n```bash\ncd ~/Desktop\ngit clone <jcode-repository-url>\ncd JcodeAgent\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Install JCode\n\n### Open Terminal/Command Prompt and Navigate to JCode\n\n**Mac/Linux:**\n```bash\ncd ~/Desktop/JcodeAgent\n```\n\n**Windows:**\n```bash\ncd %USERPROFILE%\\Desktop\\JcodeAgent\n```\n\n### Install JCode\n\n```bash\npip3 install -e .\n```\n\n**Windows users:** Use `pip install -e .` (without the 3)\n\nThis command tells Python to install JCode on your computer.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Start Ollama Server\n\nJCode needs Ollama to be running in the background.\n\n### Mac/Linux\n\nOpen a **new Terminal window** and type:\n\n```bash\nollama serve\n```\n\nLeave this window open while you use JCode.\n\n### Windows\n\nOllama starts automatically. Just make sure you see the llama icon in your system tray (bottom-right corner).\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Launch JCode!\n\n### In your original Terminal/Command Prompt window:\n\n```bash\njcode\n```\n\nYou should see the JCode banner followed by an **interactive launcher**:\n\n```\n     \u2566\u2554\u2550\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\u2554\u2566\u2557\u2554\u2550\u2557\n     \u2551\u2551  \u2551 \u2551 \u2551\u2551\u2551\u2563\n    \u255a\u255d\u255a\u2550\u255d\u255a\u2550\u255d\u2550\u2569\u255d\u255a\u2550\u255d  v0.2.0\n  \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n  Local AI Coding Agent\n  \ud83e\udde0 Planner  \u00b7 \ud83d\udcbb Coder\n  \ud83d\udd0d Reviewer \u00b7 \ud83d\udd2c Analyzer\n\n  What would you like to do?\n\n    1 \u00b7 \ud83c\udd95  Start a new project\n    2 \u00b7 \ud83d\udcc2  Continue a previous project\n    3 \u00b7 \ud83d\udce5  Import an existing project\n    4 \u00b7 \u23ed\ufe0f   Skip (go to prompt)\n```\n\nJust type the number of your choice and press Enter!\n\n**Congratulations! JCode is running!** \ud83c\udf89\n\n---\n\n## Step 8: Create Your First Project\n\n### Option 1: Use the Interactive Launcher (Easiest)\n\nWhen JCode starts, choose **1 \u00b7 Start a new project**.\n\nIt will ask you:\n1. **Where to save the project** \u2014 just press Enter for the default location, or type a path\n2. **What to build** \u2014 describe your idea in plain English\n3. **Clone from GitHub?** \u2014 if you have an existing repo, paste the URL; otherwise just say no\n\n### Option 2: From a GitHub Repository\n\nChoose **3 \u00b7 Import an existing project** from the launcher. You can:\n- Paste a **GitHub URL** (e.g. `https://github.com/user/repo`) and JCode will clone it\n- Or type a **local path** to a project folder on your computer\n\n### Option 3: At the `jcode>` Prompt\n\nIf you chose option 4 (skip) at the launcher, type at the prompt:\n\n```\nbuild a simple todo list web app with a nice interface\n```\n\n### Example: Build a Todo List Web App\n\nDescribe your idea and watch the magic happen:\n\n1. \ud83e\udde0 **Planner** figures out what files you need\n2. \ud83d\udcbb **Coder** writes the code\n3. \ud83d\udd0d **Reviewer** checks for bugs\n4. \u2705 **Verifier** tests the code\n5. \ud83d\udd2c **Analyzer** fixes any issues\n\nAfter a few minutes, you'll have a complete project in a new folder!\n\n### What If Something Goes Wrong?\n\nIf a task fails 3 times, JCode won't just crash \u2014 it will ask you what to do:\n\n- **\ud83d\udd04 Re-generate** \u2014 try from scratch with a fresh approach\n- **\ud83d\udcd0 Simplify** \u2014 create a minimal version with TODO comments for the hard parts\n- **\u23ed\ufe0f Skip** \u2014 move on to the next task\n- **\u23f8\ufe0f Pause** \u2014 pause and let you inspect the error, then provide guidance\n\n### More Example Prompts to Try\n\n```\nbuild a simple calculator app with a GUI\n```\n\n```\nbuild a REST API for managing a book library\n```\n\n```\nbuild a weather app that shows the forecast\n```\n\n```\nbuild a personal budget tracker\n```\n\n---\n\n## Understanding JCode Commands\n\nOnce JCode is running, you can use these commands:\n\n| Command | What It Does |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `build <description>` | Create a new project from your description |\n| `plan` | Show what JCode is building |\n| `tree` | See all the files JCode created |\n| `projects` | List all your past projects |\n| `resume` | Continue working on your last project |\n| `update` | Check for and install JCode updates |\n| `help` | Show all commands |\n| `quit` | Exit JCode |\n\n**Tip:** You don't have to memorize these \u2014 the interactive launcher handles the most common actions for you automatically!\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Command not found: jcode\"\n\n**Fix:**\n```bash\npip3 install -e .\n```\n\nMake sure you're in the JcodeAgent folder first.\n\n---\n\n### \"Ollama is not running\"\n\n**Mac/Linux:** Open a new Terminal and run:\n```bash\nollama serve\n```\n\n**Windows:** Make sure you see the Ollama icon in your system tray. If not, search for \"Ollama\" in Start menu and launch it.\n\n---\n\n### \"Model not found: deepseek-r1:14b\"\n\nYou need to download the models:\n```bash\nollama pull deepseek-r1:14b\nollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b\n```\n\n---\n\n### \"Error: Read-only file system\"\n\nJCode tried to create files in a protected location. When it asks where to save your project, choose a different folder like:\n- `~/Desktop/my_projects`\n- `~/Documents/jcode_projects`\n\n---\n\n### Code Has Errors\n\nJCode will automatically try to fix errors up to 3 times. If it still doesn't work, JCode will offer you 4 choices:\n\n1. **Re-generate** \u2014 try a completely fresh approach\n2. **Simplify** \u2014 create a minimal version and mark the tricky parts with TODOs\n3. **Skip** \u2014 skip that file and continue with the rest\n4. **Pause** \u2014 let you look at the error and give JCode hints\n\nYou can also:\n- Type `resume` to continue from where it left off\n- Try a simpler prompt first\n- Check that both AI models are fully downloaded\n\n---\n\n## What Happens Behind the Scenes?\n\nWhen you type `build <something>`:\n\n```\nYour idea\n    \u2193\n\ud83e\udde0 Planner creates a blueprint\n    \u2193\n\ud83d\udcbb Coder writes the files one by one\n    \u2193\n\ud83d\udd0d Reviewer checks each file for bugs\n    \u2193\n\u2705 Verifier runs tests\n    \u2193\n\ud83d\udd2c Analyzer fixes any errors\n    \u2193\n\ud83d\udcc1 Complete working project!\n```\n\nAll of this happens **on your computer**. No data is sent to the cloud. No subscriptions. Completely free and private.\n\n---\n\n## Where Are My Projects Saved?\n\nBy default, JCode saves projects to:\n- **Mac/Linux:** `~/jcode_projects/`\n- **Windows:** `C:\\Users\\YourName\\jcode_projects\\`\n\nYou can change this with the `settings` command.\n\n---\n\n## Tips for Better Results\n\n### \u2705 Good Prompts\n\n```\nbuild a simple todo list web app with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript\n```\n\n```\nbuild a REST API with Python FastAPI for managing blog posts\n```\n\n```\nbuild a calculator app with a graphical interface using Python tkinter\n```\n\n### \u274c Vague Prompts\n\n```\nbuild something cool\n```\n\n```\nmake an app\n```\n\n**Tip:** Be specific about what you want. Mention the technology if you know it, or describe the features clearly.\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Experiment!** Try building simple projects to get comfortable\n2. **Read the files** JCode creates \u2014 you'll learn by seeing the code\n3. **Modify projects** \u2014 JCode creates a starting point, you can edit the files yourself\n4. **Try `resume`** \u2014 if a project didn't work perfectly, resume and try again\n\n---\n\n## Still Need Help?\n\n- Type `help` inside JCode for a command reference\n- Check `README.md` for technical details\n- Check `FEATURES.md` for a full feature list\n\n---\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n**Q: Do I need internet?**  \nA: Only for the initial setup (downloading Python, Ollama, and the AI models). After that, JCode works 100% offline.\n\n**Q: Is it really free?**  \nA: Yes! Everything is open-source and runs locally on your machine.\n\n**Q: How much disk space do I need?**  \nA: About 20 GB for the AI models, plus space for your projects.\n\n**Q: Can I use this for commercial projects?**  \nA: Yes, JCode is MIT licensed. The code it generates is yours.\n\n**Q: Will this work on my old computer?**  \nA: You need at least 16 GB of RAM. The AI models are quite large.\n\n**Q: Can I use different AI models?**  \nA: Yes, but you'll need to edit `jcode/config.py` to change the model names.\n\n**Q: What if the code doesn't work?**  \nA: JCode will automatically try to fix errors. You can also type `resume` to retry.\n\n---\n\n**Ready to build? Type `jcode` and let's go!** \ud83d\ude80\n",
      "CHANGELOG.md": "# Changelog\n\n## v0.9.9 \u2014 Reliability: Files Actually Get Written\n\nCritical reliability fixes discovered during real-world testing. The agent was generating correct code but never writing it to disk because models don't follow the exact output format. This release makes JCode bulletproof regardless of how the model formats its output.\n\n### Robust File Parser (THE critical fix)\n- **Multi-strategy parser**: `_apply_file_changes()` now handles 4 output formats:\n  - **Format 1**: `===FILE: path=== ... ===END===` (ideal, standard)\n  - **Format 2**: `===FILE: path===` followed by ` ```lang ... ``` ` (common model behavior \u2014 no ===END===)\n  - **Format 3**: Markdown headings (`### main.py`) or bold (`**main.py**`) followed by code blocks\n  - **Format 4**: `===FILE: path===` followed by raw content split at next marker (ultimate fallback)\n- **Confirmation message**: Shows `\u2713 N file(s) written to disk` after successful writes\n- **Build pipeline coder**: `_strip_fences()` in coder.py now handles models that add explanations around code blocks\n\n### Model Registry Fix\n- **Removed `qwen3-coder:8b`** \u2014 this model does not exist on Ollama (caused silent pull failures)\n- **Changed `qwen3-coder:32b` \u2192 `qwen3-coder:30b`** \u2014 the actual available model (19GB)\n- Only `qwen3-coder:30b` and `qwen3-coder:480b` exist as of June 2025\n\n### Crash Protection (KeyboardInterrupt)\n- **Ctrl+C during model streaming** no longer crashes the app \u2014 returns partial output gracefully\n- **Ctrl+C in REPL routing** caught \u2014 returns to prompt instead of stack trace\n- **General exception handling** in REPL mode dispatch \u2014 errors are displayed cleanly\n- `_stream()` in ollama_client.py: wrapped in try/except KeyboardInterrupt, shows partial output length\n\n### Strengthened System Prompts\n- **AGENTIC_SYSTEM**: Complete rewrite with explicit format rules, correct/incorrect examples, visual section separators\n- **Mode 1 (ACTION) prompt**: Stronger ===END=== requirement, explicit \"no markdown fences\" rule\n- Models now see concrete examples of correct vs incorrect file block formatting\n- Triple-reinforced: \"Remember: ===FILE:=== then raw code then ===END===. No markdown fences inside file blocks. Ever.\"\n\n### Display Text Cleanup\n- Response display now strips all file block formats (not just ===END=== ones) before showing summary panel\n\n## v0.9.8 \u2014 Simplified Two-Mode Architecture\n\nMajor refactor: JCode now has a clean two-mode architecture. No more intent classification \u2014 every message goes straight to the active mode handler.\n\n### Two Modes\n- **\u26a1 Agentic (default)**: Every message triggers autonomous action \u2014 classify, generate, auto-run, auto-fix. No ambiguity.\n- **\ud83d\udcac Chat**: Conversational mode with reasoning, web search, explanations \u2014 but NO file modifications. Fully read-only.\n- Switch with `/agentic` or `/chat`\n\n### Slash Commands\n- All utility commands now use `/` prefix: `/run`, `/commit`, `/push`, `/pull`, `/status`, `/log`, `/diff`, `/remote`, `/files`, `/tree`, `/plan`, `/models`, `/help`, `/version`, `/update`, `/clear`, `/quit`\n- Slash commands work identically in both modes\n\n### Agentic Intelligence\n- **Task classification on every request**: `classify_task()` runs before every agentic action \u2014 selects optimal models based on complexity \u00d7 size\n- **Model routing**: Shows classification label and routed models for transparency\n- **Build detection**: Prompts like \"build a tinder for linkedin\" auto-route to the full build pipeline (classify \u2192 research \u2192 plan \u2192 generate \u2192 review \u2192 verify \u2192 fix \u2192 run)\n- **Auto-run after code generation**: After writing files, JCode auto-detects and runs the project\n- **Auto-fix loop**: If run fails, JCode feeds the error back to the model and retries (up to 3 attempts)\n\n### Run Detection Improvements\n- Node.js entry files (`app.js`, `index.js`, `server.js`) now detected in subdirectories (`server/`, `backend/`, `src/`, `api/`)\n- `package.json` `main` field used as fallback when no scripts are defined\n- More subdirectories searched for `package.json` (`app/` added)\n\n### Architecture Cleanup\n- Removed intent classification system from REPL (no more `classify_intent()` calls)\n- Removed `_handle_navigate()` and `_handle_git()` \u2014 logic inlined into slash command handler\n- Added `_run_fix_prompt()` helper \u2014 shared by `/run` auto-fix, build post-fix, and agentic auto-fix\n- Chat mode (`_cmd_chat`) is now strictly read-only \u2014 strips any ===FILE:=== or ===RUN:=== blocks\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/cli.py` \u2014 Major refactor: new REPL with slash commands, `_cmd_agentic()` with classification + auto-run, `_agentic_auto_run()`, `_run_fix_prompt()`, read-only `_cmd_chat()`, improved `_detect_run_command()`\n- `jcode/__init__.py` \u2014 Version bump to 0.9.8\n- `pyproject.toml` \u2014 Version bump to 0.9.8\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.7 \u2014 Model Pull UX Improvements\n\nBugfix & UX: Model pulling now shows real progress (bytes downloaded, transfer speed), handles Ctrl+C gracefully, and gives better size estimates.\n\n### Model Pull Improvements\n- **Real progress tracking**: Shows bytes downloaded and transfer speed (was stuck at 0%)\n- **Graceful cancellation**: Press Ctrl+C during download to skip a model and continue with fallback\n- **Accurate size estimates**: 70B models \u2192 40GB, 32B \u2192 20GB, 14B \u2192 9GB, 7B \u2192 5GB (was flat 12GB estimate)\n- **Better feedback**: \"Skipped \u2014 will use fallback\" when cancelled, \"may take 10-30min per model\" warning\n- **Tip shown**: User is informed they can press Ctrl+C to skip slow downloads\n\n### Technical Changes\n- `pull_model()` now uses `Live` progress with `DownloadColumn` and `TransferSpeedColumn`\n- Catches `KeyboardInterrupt` at two levels (inner loop + outer function) for clean exit\n- Returns `False` on cancellation instead of crashing\n- `ensure_models_for_complexity()` handles partial success (some models pulled, some skipped)\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/config.py` \u2014 Rewritten `pull_model()` with better progress tracking and KeyboardInterrupt handling\n- `jcode/ollama_client.py` \u2014 Improved size estimates and user feedback in `ensure_models_for_complexity()`\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.6 \u2014 Interactive Model Pulling\n\nFeature: JCode now detects missing ideal models and offers to pull them before starting a build. Users can choose to download recommended models or continue with fallback models.\n\n### Interactive Model Management\n- Before starting a build, JCode checks if all ideal models for the task classification are installed\n- If missing models are detected, shows a table comparing ideal vs. fallback models for each role\n- Prompts user: \"Pull missing models now?\" with Yes/No choice\n- If Yes: pulls each missing model with progress bar, then continues with ideal models\n- If No: continues immediately with fallback models (no delay, no errors)\n- Example: `heavy/large` task recommends `deepseek-r1:70b` (not installed) \u2192 offers to pull or falls back to `deepseek-r1:14b`\n\n### New Functions\n- `get_ideal_and_actual_models()` \u2014 returns role \u2192 (ideal_model, actual_model, is_fallback) mapping\n- `get_missing_ideal_models()` \u2014 returns list of missing ideal models grouped by roles\n- `pull_model()` \u2014 pulls a model from Ollama registry with progress bar\n- Enhanced `ensure_models_for_complexity()` \u2014 interactive pre-check with pull option (was a stub)\n\n### User Experience\n```\n\u26a0 Some ideal models are not installed:\n\n  Role        Ideal Model           Will Use              Status\n  planner     deepseek-r1:70b       deepseek-r1:14b       fallback\n  coder       qwen3-coder:32b       qwen2.5-coder:32b     fallback\n  reviewer    qwen2.5-coder:14b     qwen2.5-coder:14b     \u2713\n  analyzer    deepseek-r1:14b       deepseek-r1:14b       \u2713\n\n  Missing models: deepseek-r1:70b, qwen3-coder:32b\n  Estimated download: ~24GB\n\nPull missing models now? (if no, will use fallback models) [y/N]:\n```\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/config.py` \u2014 `get_ideal_and_actual_models()`, `get_missing_ideal_models()`, `pull_model()` with progress bar\n- `jcode/ollama_client.py` \u2014 Enhanced `ensure_models_for_complexity()` with interactive pull workflow\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.5 \u2014 Model Fallback Fix\n\nCritical bugfix: `_is_model_local()` incorrectly matched different quantizations of the same base model. When requesting `deepseek-r1:70b` (not installed), it returned True because `deepseek-r1:14b` was installed, causing `model 'deepseek-r1:70b' not found (status code: 404)` errors.\n\n### Model Resolution Fix\n- `_is_model_local()` now requires EXACT name match (including quantization tag)\n- Previously: `\"deepseek-r1:70b\"` matched `\"deepseek-r1:14b\"` via `startswith()` check on base name\n- Now: Only matches if full name is in local models (handles `:latest` normalization correctly)\n- Fallback now works correctly: `heavy/large` planner requests `reasoning/large` \u2192 no exact match \u2192 falls back to `deepseek-r1:14b` (reasoning/medium)\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/config.py` \u2014 Fixed `_is_model_local()` to match full model names, not base prefixes\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.4 \u2014 Smart Classification (LLM + Semantic Signals)\n\nCritical fix: \"build a tinder for linkedin\" was classified as `simple/small` \u2192 now correctly classified as `heavy/large`. Short prompts describing complex apps no longer fall through to the default.\n\n### LLM-Based Pre-Classification\n- New `_llm_classify()` calls the fastest available model to reason about task complexity before keyword matching\n- Uses a structured classification prompt that understands what \"build a tinder for X\" actually implies (auth, database, matching, profiles, etc.)\n- Adds ~1-3s but prevents catastrophic misclassification of short prompts\n- Falls back gracefully to keyword-only scoring if no model is available\n- LLM result is fused with keyword scoring \u2014 the HIGHER classification always wins (err on the side of giving more resources)\n\n### App-Type Complexity Signals\n- Added \"clone\" signals to `_HEAVY_SIGNALS`: \"like tinder\", \"uber for\", \"a spotify\", \"an airbnb\", etc. \u2014 covers 19 major platforms\n- Added domain signals to `_HEAVY_SIGNALS`: \"social network\", \"marketplace\", \"dating app\", \"matching system\", \"recommendation engine\", \"booking system\", \"fintech\", \"saas\", etc.\n- Added domain signals to `_MEDIUM_SIGNALS`: \"web app\", \"mobile app\", \"game\", \"analytics\", \"profile\", \"search\", \"forum\", etc.\n- \"build a tinder for linkedin\" now matches 2 heavy signals \u2192 `heavy/medium` from keywords alone (LLM pushes to `heavy/large`)\n\n### Default Classification Bias Fix\n- When no keyword signals match AND no LLM available, default is now `medium/medium` instead of `simple/small`\n- Only classify as `simple` when explicit simple signals are present (\"simple\", \"basic\", \"calculator\", \"todo\", \"landing page\")\n- Short prompts with no signals (e.g., \"build a weather app\") now get `medium/medium` instead of being penalized\n\n### Classification Examples (Before \u2192 After)\n| Prompt | Before | After |\n|--------|--------|-------|\n| \"build a tinder for linkedin\" | simple/small | heavy/large |\n| \"build a weather app\" | simple/small | medium/medium |\n| \"build me an uber for dogs\" | simple/small | heavy/large |\n| \"create a social network\" | simple/small | medium/medium |\n| \"build a dating app with matching\" | simple/small | heavy/medium |\n| \"build a simple calculator\" | simple/small | simple/small \u2713 |\n| \"make a landing page\" | simple/small | simple/small \u2713 |\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/config.py` \u2014 `_llm_classify()`, `_CLASSIFY_PROMPT`, expanded `_HEAVY_SIGNALS` (19 app-type + 12 domain signals), expanded `_MEDIUM_SIGNALS` (12 domain signals), `_classify_from_prompt()` rewritten with 2-phase LLM+keyword fusion, default bias fix\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.3 \u2014 Fence Stripping & Execution Safety\n\nBugfix: models wrap `===FILE:===` content in markdown fences (` ```json ``` `), corrupting files like `package.json`. Commands now stop on failure instead of blindly continuing.\n\n### Markdown Fence Stripping\n- New `_strip_content_fences()` strips ` ```lang ``` ` from file content inside `===FILE:===` blocks\n- Handles `json`, `javascript`, `python`, `typescript`, and bare ` ``` ` fences\n- Applied automatically in `_apply_file_changes()` before writing to disk\n- Fixes: `package.json` written with backtick fences \u2192 `npm install EJSONPARSE`\n\n### Command Execution: Stop on Failure\n- `_apply_run_commands()` now stops executing remaining `===RUN:===` commands when one fails\n- Prevents cascading failures (e.g., `npm start` running after `npm install` fails)\n- Shows \"Stopping \u2014 fix the error before continuing\" message\n- `===BACKGROUND:===` commands are not affected (they don't block)\n\n### Run Command Detection Improvements\n- Added Node.js entry file fallback: `app.js`, `index.js`, `server.js`, `main.js` detected even without `package.json`\n- `_detect_run_command` now logs a warning when `package.json` has invalid JSON instead of silently failing\n- Detection order: Python entry \u2192 `package.json` scripts \u2192 HTML \u2192 Node.js entry \u2192 any `.py` file\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/cli.py` \u2014 `_strip_content_fences()`, stop-on-failure in `_apply_run_commands()`, Node.js fallback in `_detect_run_command()`, JSON parse error logging\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.2 \u2014 Autonomous Execution\n\nCritical fix: agent mode now actually executes commands and builds projects end-to-end instead of just printing instructions.\n\n### Intent Classification Fix\n- Added `_BUILD_PATTERNS` \u2014 \"i want you to build an app\", \"create a website\", \"make me a dashboard\" now correctly classify as BUILD (previously fell through to CHAT)\n- BUILD patterns score 1.5\u00d7 and always win over CHAT in tie-breaking\n- Added RUN patterns: \"get the project running\", \"auto run\", \"run the commands\", \"install and run\"\n- \"i want you to build an app that shows weather info\" now triggers the full build pipeline instead of a chat response\n\n### Agent Mode Routes All Input to Agentic Handler\n- In agent mode, CHAT-classified input now routes to `_cmd_agentic()` instead of `_cmd_chat()`\n- This means ANY request in agent mode gets autonomous file creation + command execution\n- Chat mode still uses `_cmd_chat()` for conversational responses\n\n### Command Execution (`===RUN:===` / `===BACKGROUND:===`)\n- New `_apply_run_commands()` function parses and executes shell commands from model output\n- `===RUN: command===` \u2014 synchronous execution with output display (120s timeout)\n- `===BACKGROUND: command===` \u2014 background processes for servers/watchers\n- Safety filter blocks dangerous commands (rm -rf /, sudo rm, mkfs, dd, fork bombs)\n- Output capped at 20 lines per command for clean display\n- Wired into both `_cmd_agentic()` and `_cmd_chat()` \u2014 files applied before commands run\n\n### Updated Prompts\n- `AGENTIC_SYSTEM`: now instructs model to emit `===RUN:===` blocks for package installation, project setup, and server startup \u2014 never tell user to run manually\n- `AGENTIC_TASK`: changed \"Modification Request\" to \"Request\", added autonomous mode instructions\n- `CHAT_SYSTEM` MODE 3: updated to emit `===RUN:===` blocks instead of showing commands to copy-paste\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/intent.py` \u2014 Added `_BUILD_PATTERNS`, expanded `_RUN_PATTERNS`, BUILD always wins over CHAT\n- `jcode/cli.py` \u2014 CHAT\u2192agentic routing in agent mode, `_apply_run_commands()`, command block stripping in display\n- `jcode/prompts.py` \u2014 `===RUN:===`/`===BACKGROUND:===` format in AGENTIC_SYSTEM, CHAT_SYSTEM, AGENTIC_TASK\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.1 \u2014 Spec Contracts, RAG Memory & Structured Errors\n\nImplements the frontier-grade coding agent blueprint: planner outputs formal specs, coder enforces them as contracts, embedding-based RAG memory provides cross-file context, and structured error parsing enables smarter fix loops.\n\n### Spec-as-Contract Pipeline\n- **Planner** now outputs formal spec fields: `database_schema`, `api_surface`, `auth_flow`, `deployment`\n- **Coder** enforces spec compliance: \"NO STACK DRIFT \u2014 if the spec says React, don't use Vue\"\n- `get_spec_details()` extracts spec from plan and injects into every CODER_TASK prompt\n- Simple projects gracefully skip formal spec fields\n\n### Embedding-Based RAG Memory (`memory.py`)\n- New `ProjectMemory` class with `FileEmbedding` dataclass\n- `index_files()`: embeds file summaries with MD5 change detection (skips unchanged files)\n- `retrieve()`: cosine similarity search over embeddings\n- `get_relevant_context()`: formatted RAG context for prompt injection\n- Lazy initialization \u2014 only activates when an embedding model is installed\n- Full serialization via `to_dict()` / `from_dict()` for session persistence\n- Graceful fallback: all methods return empty results if no embedding model available\n\n### RAG Integration\n- Memory indexed before first wave and re-indexed after each generation wave\n- Coder receives \"Semantically Related\" context from RAG alongside dependency context\n- Session save/load preserves vector memory embeddings\n- `ctx.index_memory()` and `ctx.get_relevant_files()` convenience methods on ContextManager\n\n### Expanded Model Registry\n- **Coding**: Added `qwen3-coder:32b/8b` (priority 5 \u2014 highest), `deepseek-coder:33b/6.7b`\n- **Reasoning**: Added `deepseek-r1:70b` (priority 5 for large reasoning tasks)\n- **Summarizer**: Added `phi4:14b`, `phi3.5:latest`, `gemma3:4b` \u2014 new category\n- **Embedding**: Added `all-minilm:latest`, `nomic-embed-text:latest` \u2014 new category\n- **General**: Added `llama3.3:latest`, `llama3.1:latest`\n- `ModelSpec` extended with `is_embedding: bool` field\n- New helpers: `get_embedding_model()`, `get_summarizer_model()`\n\n### Structured Error Parsing\n- `VerificationResult.structured_errors` property parses raw error output\n- Extracts Python errors (`File \"path\", line N`), JS/ruff errors (`path:line:col: message`)\n- Returns `{file, line, category, message}` dicts for targeted fix routing\n\n### Size Threading\n- `size` parameter now threaded through entire pipeline: planner \u2192 coder \u2192 reviewer \u2192 analyzer \u2192 iteration\n- All `get_model_for_role()` calls include both complexity and size\n- Display shows `Classification: complexity/size` throughout\n\n### Files Changed\n- `jcode/memory.py` \u2014 **New**: Full RAG memory module (230+ lines)\n- `jcode/config.py` \u2014 Expanded MODEL_REGISTRY, added embedding/summarizer categories and helpers\n- `jcode/prompts.py` \u2014 Planner spec schema, coder spec enforcement, CODER_TASK `{spec_details}`\n- `jcode/context.py` \u2014 ProjectMemory integration, spec extraction, session persistence\n- `jcode/coder.py` \u2014 RAG context injection, size threading, spec_details in prompts\n- `jcode/executor.py` \u2014 structured_errors property on VerificationResult\n- `jcode/iteration.py` \u2014 Memory indexing per wave, size threading\n- `jcode/planner.py` \u2014 Size threading, display update\n- `jcode/reviewer.py` \u2014 Size threading\n- `jcode/analyzer.py` \u2014 Size threading\n\n---\n\n## v0.9.0 \u2014 Multi-Model Orchestrator\n\nMajor architecture redesign \u2014 JCode becomes an intelligent orchestrator that classifies tasks by complexity and size, then routes to the best available model for each role.\n\n### Task Classification System\n- **Complexity levels**: Heavy, Medium, Simple \u2014 detected from prompt keywords and project context\n- **Size levels**: Large, Medium, Small \u2014 based on file count and scope\n- **Matrix routing**: Each (complexity \u00d7 size) combination maps to optimal models per role (planner, coder, reviewer, analyzer)\n- Fast path for simple tasks, deep research pipeline for heavy tasks\n\n### Multi-Model Registry\n- `ModelSpec` dataclass: name, category, tier, supports_thinking, supports_tools, context_default, priority\n- `MODEL_REGISTRY`: extensible dict of all known models with capabilities\n- `MODEL_CATEGORIES`: coding, reasoning, agentic \u2014 each listing available models\n- Automatic fallback chains when preferred models aren't installed\n- `get_model_for_role()`: resolves best available model with graceful degradation\n\n### Simplified Modes\n- Two modes: **agent** and **chat** \u2014 switch by typing `agent` or `chat`\n- Removed legacy mode complexity (plan/agentic/etc.)\n- Agent mode: full build pipeline with classification-based routing\n- Chat mode: conversational coding assistance\n\n### Research Pipeline (Heavy Tasks)\n- `research_pipeline()`: parallel web search + documentation fetching\n- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent research\n- `RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM` prompt synthesizes findings into actionable context\n- Automatically triggered when task is classified as heavy\n\n### Enhanced Prompts\n- All role prompts (Planner, Coder, Reviewer, Analyzer) rewritten with stronger guidelines\n- Chat prompt enhanced with runtime error handling instructions\n- Agentic prompt enhanced for orchestrator behavior\n\n### New Commands\n- `models` \u2014 Shows available models, categories, and routing table\n- `agent` / `chat` \u2014 Direct mode switching\n\n### Rewritten Files\n- `jcode/config.py` \u2014 Complete rewrite: enums, ModelSpec, MODEL_REGISTRY, classify_task(), ROLE_ROUTING, get_model_for_role(), describe_model_plan()\n- `jcode/ollama_client.py` \u2014 Complete rewrite: _is_reasoning_model(), _get_options_for_model(), model-category-aware option tuning\n- `jcode/prompts.py` \u2014 Complete rewrite: enhanced all role prompts, added RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM\n\n### Updated Files\n- `jcode/cli.py` \u2014 Build pipeline uses classification, mode switching, models command\n- `jcode/intent.py` \u2014 Added Intent.MODE, agent/chat as exact commands\n- `jcode/web.py` \u2014 Added research_pipeline() for heavy task research\n- `jcode/context.py` \u2014 Added get_size() method\n- `install.sh` / `install.ps1` \u2014 Updated model lists (+ deepseek-r1:14b)\n\n### Backward Compatibility\n- Legacy `detect_complexity()` wrapper preserved\n- Legacy model constants (PLANNER_MODEL, etc.) preserved as aliases\n- Default `size=\"medium\"` parameter ensures existing callers work unchanged\n- Unchanged modules: planner.py, iteration.py, coder.py, reviewer.py, analyzer.py, file_manager.py, settings.py, executor.py\n\n---\n\n## v0.8.1 \u2014 Speed Fix\n\n### Fixed\n- Replaced deepseek-r1 with qwen2.5-coder for all roles \u2014 eliminates 2+ minute thinking pauses\n- Added `<think>` tag filtering for reasoning model output cleanup\n\n---\n\n## v0.8.0 \u2014 Performance Overhaul\n\n### Fixed\n- Fixed 5+ minute builds caused by model pulling on every request\n- Implemented never-pull policy \u2014 uses only locally available models\n- Optimized model selection to prefer already-loaded models\n\n---\n\n## v0.7.0 \u2014 CWD-Aware

Created Next.js project structure  \n\u2705 2. Converted HTML pages to React components  \n\u2705 3. Migrated API endpoints to Next.js API routes  \n\u2705 4. Extracted shared components (Header, Footer, etc.)  \n\u2705 5. Converted CSS to Tailwind utility classes  \n\u2705 6. Copied assets (favicon, icons) to `public/`  \n\u2705 7. Configured vercel.json for routing  \n\n## Next Steps (TODO)\n\n\u2b1c 1. Install dependencies:\n```bash\ncd frontend\nnpm install\n```\n\n\u2b1c 2. Test locally:\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# Visit http://localhost:3000\n```\n\n\u2b1c 3. Build for production:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\n\u2b1c 4. Deploy to Vercel:\n```bash\nvercel --prod\n```\n\n## Vercel Configuration\n\nThe new `frontend/vercel.json` handles routing:\n- `/install.sh` \u2192 `/api/install.sh` (Next.js route)\n- `/install.ps1` \u2192 `/api/install.ps1` (Next.js route)\n\nAnalytics still require Vercel KV (same setup as before).\n\n## Backward Compatibility\n\n- All URLs remain the same (`/`, `/guide`, `/technical`, `/api/stats`)\n- Install commands unchanged (`curl https://getjcode.vercel.app/install.sh | bash`)\n- Analytics schema unchanged (same KV keys)\n\n## Old `docs/` Folder\n\nThe old `docs/` folder can be kept as reference or archived. The frontend is now fully standalone in `frontend/`.\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nNow that we're on Next.js, we can easily add:\n- Blog with MDX support\n- Search functionality\n- Interactive demos\n- User authentication (if needed)\n- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI\n- Real-time stats dashboard (WebSocket)\n",

[~/jcode_projects]:\n```\n\nChoose a directory where all your generated projects will be saved (defaults to `~/jcode_projects`).\n\n## Building Your First Project\n\n```\njcode> build a REST API with FastAPI for a todo list with SQLite\n```\n\nJCode will:\n1. **Analyze complexity** \u2014 detects it's a medium complexity project\n2. **Plan the structure** \u2014 creates file/folder layout\n3. **Ask for confirmation** \u2014 you can review before generating\n4. **Generate all files** \u2014 writes code with proper dependencies\n5. **Validate & fix** \u2014 runs checks and auto-corrects errors\n6. **Auto-save** \u2014 stores project metadata for later\n\n## Project Complexity Detection\n\nJCode automatically detects project complexity and adjusts context windows:\n\n| Complexity | File Count | Features | Context Size |\n|------------|-----------|----------|--------------|\n| **Simple** | 1-3 files | Basic logic | 1.0x (16k) |\n| **Medium** | 4-10 files | Moderate features | 1.5x (24k) |\n| **Complex** | 11-20 files | DB, API, Auth | 2.0x (32k) |\n| **Large** | 20+ files | Full application | 2.5x (40k) |\n\nThe system considers:\n- Number of files and tasks\n- Tech stack (database, API, auth, tests)\n- Feature complexity\n\n## Resuming Projects\n\nList all your saved projects:\n```\njcode> projects\n```\n\nResume working on one:\n```\njcode> resume my_project_name\n```\n\nJCode will load the full session including:\n- All generated files\n- Conversation history\n- Current state and errors\n- Output directory\n\n## Iterating on a Project\n\nAfter generating a project, you can continue working on it:\n\n```\njcode> add a login page with email/password authentication\n```\n\nJCode will:\n- Understand the existing project context\n- Generate/modify only the necessary files\n- Maintain consistency with existing code\n- Auto-save progress\n\n## Useful Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `plan` | Show current project structure |\n| `files` | List all generated files |\n| `tree` | Visual directory tree |\n| `projects` | List all saved projects |\n| `resume <name>` | Continue a project |\n| `settings` | View configuration |\n| `clear` | Start fresh (auto-saves current) |\n\n## Settings Location\n\nAll JCode data is stored in `~/.jcode/`:\n\n```\n~/.jcode/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 settings.json           # User preferences\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 projects/              # Project metadata\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 my_api.json\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 todo_app.json\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 ...\n```\n\nEach generated project also has a hidden session file:\n```\n~/jcode_projects/my_project/.jcode_session.json\n```\n\n## Tips\n\n### 1. Be Specific in Prompts\n\u274c \"build a website\"  \n\u2705 \"build a React portfolio website with a projects page, about page, and contact form using TailwindCSS\"\n\n### 2. Iterate Incrementally\nAfter generating the base:\n```\njcode> add unit tests for all API endpoints\njcode> add error handling and logging\njcode> add a README with setup instructions\n```\n\n### 3. Check Before Confirming\nAlways review the plan before saying \"yes\" to generation:\n- File structure makes sense?\n- Tech stack is correct?\n- Tasks are in the right order?\n\n### 4. Use Project Complexity Wisely\nFor large projects, break them into phases:\n```\njcode> build the backend API first (Phase 1)\n# (after completion)\njcode> clear\njcode> now build the frontend dashboard (Phase 2)\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### \"Read-only file system\" error\n\u2705 **Fixed!** Now validates and expands paths properly.\n\nUse full paths or `~/directory` notation:\n- \u2713 `/Users/you/projects/myapp`\n- \u2713 `~/Desktop/myapp`\n- \u2717 `/myapp` (root filesystem)\n\n### Project not resuming\nCheck if the session file exists:\n```bash\nls ~/jcode_projects/my_project/.jcode_session.json\n```\n\nIf missing, JCode can only show metadata. The files are still there, but conversation history is lost.\n\n### Models not found\nOn first run, JCode auto-downloads models. If interrupted:\n```bash\nollama pull deepseek-r1:14b\nollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Experiment with different project types\n- Try the `projects` command to see your portfolio\n- Use `resume` to continue multi-session projects\n- Check `~/.jcode/settings.json` to customize defaults\n",
      "README.md": "# JCode \ud83e\udd16\n\n> **A local AI coding agent powered by Ollama** \u2014 plans, generates, reviews, and iterates on full projects using 4 specialized AI roles.\n\n![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.10+-blue)\n![Ollama](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ollama-local%20LLM-green)\n![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow)\n\n## How It Works\n\n```\nPrompt \u2192 \ud83e\udde0 Planner \u2192 \ud83d\udcbb Coder \u2192 \ud83d\udd0d Reviewer \u2192 \u2705 Verify \u2192 \ud83d\udd2c Analyzer \u2192 \ud83d\udd04 Fix \u2192 \u2705 Done\n```\n\nJCode uses **4 AI roles** (same local models, different specialised prompts) to build software the way an engineering team would:\n\n1. **\ud83e\udde0 Plan** \u2014 DeepSeek-R1 creates architecture, dependency graph, and a DAG of tasks\n2. **\ud83d\udcbb Code** \u2014 Qwen2.5-Coder generates each file using structured memory (not raw plan dumps)\n3. **\ud83d\udd0d Review** \u2014 Pre-execution code review catches bugs *before* they run\n4. **\u2705 Verify** \u2014 Static analysis: syntax check, linting (ruff/flake8), type checks\n5. **\ud83d\udd2c Analyze** \u2014 If verification fails, the Analyzer diagnoses the root cause\n6. **\ud83d\udd04 Patch** \u2014 Targeted minimal fix applied; re-verify; repeat up to 3\u00d7\n7. **\u2705 Done** \u2014 Verified project output with full DAG completion\n\n### Key Innovations\n\n- **DAG Task Tree** \u2014 tasks have dependencies; a file isn't generated until its deps are verified\n- **Structured Memory** \u2014 architecture summary + file index + failure log (not context dumps)\n- **Patch Mode** \u2014 fixes are minimal targeted patches, not full regeneration\n- **Self-Correction** \u2014 Analyzer\u2192Coder feedback loop avoids repeating the same mistake\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- **Python 3.10+**\n- **Ollama** installed and running (`ollama serve`)\n- ~20 GB disk space for both models\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### One-Command Install (Recommended)\n\n**Mac / Linux:**\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShakenTheCoder/JcodeAgent/main/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n**Windows (PowerShell):**\n```powershell\niwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShakenTheCoder/JcodeAgent/main/install.ps1 | iex\n```\n\nInstalls Python, Ollama, AI models, and JCode \u2014 only what's missing. Then just run `jcode`.\n\n### Manual Install\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone / navigate to the project\ncd JcodeAgent\n\n# 2. Install\npip install -e .\n\n# 3. Start Ollama (in another terminal)\nollama serve\n\n# 4. Pull models (first time only)\nollama pull deepseek-r1:14b\nollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b\n\n# 5. Launch JCode\njcode\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\njcode> build a REST API with FastAPI that manages a todo list with SQLite\n```\n\nJCode will:\n1. Plan the architecture and create a dependency-ordered task DAG\n2. Generate each file with full architectural context\n3. Review each file for bugs before execution\n4. Run static analysis (syntax + lint)\n5. Auto-diagnose and patch any failures\n6. Output the complete verified project\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `build <prompt>` | Full pipeline: plan \u2192 generate \u2192 review \u2192 verify \u2192 fix |\n| `plan` | Show current plan and task statuses |\n| `files` | List generated files with sizes |\n| `tree` | Show project directory tree |\n| `projects` | List all saved projects |\n| `resume` | Resume last project |\n| `save` | Manually save session |\n| `load <path>` | Load session from file |\n| `settings` | View/edit settings |\n| `clear` | Clear screen |\n| `help` | Show help |\n| `quit` | Exit JCode |\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\njcode/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py          # Package metadata (v0.2.0)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __main__.py          # python -m jcode entry\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cli.py               # Rich interactive CLI\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.py            # Models, TaskStatus, TaskNode, ProjectState\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 prompts.py           # All 4 role prompt templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ollama_client.py     # Unified model caller with role dispatch\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 context.py           # Structured memory engine + DAG\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 planner.py           # Plan creation (DeepSeek-R1)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 coder.py             # File generation + patch mode\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 reviewer.py          # Pre-execution code review\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 analyzer.py          # Error diagnosis + fix strategy\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 executor.py          # Verification pipeline (syntax/lint/type)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 iteration.py         # DAG-based orchestration engine\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 file_manager.py      # File I/O + Rich directory tree\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 settings.py          # Persistent user settings\n```\n\n## 4-Role System\n\n| Role | Model | Prompt Style | Purpose |\n|------|-------|-------------|---------|\n| \ud83e\udde0 Planner | `deepseek-r1:14b` | Architecture-focused | Task DAG, tech stack, dependency graph |\n| \ud83d\udcbb Coder | `qwen2.5-coder:14b` | Implementation-focused | File generation, targeted patches |\n| \ud83d\udd0d Reviewer | `qwen2.5-coder:14b` | Audit-focused | Pre-execution bug/security review |\n| \ud83d\udd2c Analyzer | `deepseek-r1:14b` | Diagnostic-focused | Root cause analysis, fix strategy |\n\nSame model weights, different system prompts = role specialisation without extra downloads.\n\n## Task Pipeline\n\n```\nFor each task in DAG order:\n\n  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n  \u2502 GENERATE \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502  REVIEW  \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502  VERIFY  \u2502\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                       \u2502                 \u2502\n                  issues?            passed?\n                       \u2502                 \u2502\n                  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510      \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                  \u2502  PATCH   \u2502      \u2502VERIFIED\u2502\n                  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518      \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                       \u2502\n                       \u2502 still fails?\n                       \u2502\n                  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                  \u2502 ANALYZE  \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502  PATCH   \u251c\u2500\u2500\u25ba re-verify (up to 3\u00d7)\n                  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in `~/.jcode/settings.json`:\n- Default output directory\n- Auto-save preference\n- Project metadata in `~/.jcode/projects/`\n\nSessions are auto-saved to `.jcode_session.json` in each project directory and can be resumed with `resume`.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",

Perfect for planning and diagnosis.\n- **Qwen2.5-Coder** is a code-specialised model \u2014 it produces cleaner, more syntactically correct code. Perfect for generation and review.\n- Low temperature on Coder (0.15) = deterministic, consistent output.\n- Higher temperature on Planner (0.6) = creative architecture exploration.\n\n### Role Isolation\n\nEach role has:\n- Its own system prompt (defined in `prompts.py`)\n- Its own conversation history (stored in `context.py`)\n- Its own context slice (only receives relevant information)\n\nThis prevents \"role confusion\" where the model might mix planning with coding.\n\n---\n\n## DAG Task Engine\n\nTasks are **not** executed linearly. They form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\n### TaskNode\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass TaskNode:\n    id: int\n    file: str              # e.g., \"src/models.py\"\n    description: str       # e.g., \"Define SQLAlchemy models\"\n    depends_on: list[int]  # e.g., [1, 2] \u2014 must be VERIFIED first\n    status: TaskStatus     # State machine\n    failure_count: int     # Per-task failure counter\n    error_summary: str     # Last error for this task\n    review_feedback: str   # Last reviewer feedback\n```\n\n### State Machine\n\n```\nPENDING \u2192 IN_PROGRESS \u2192 GENERATED \u2192 REVIEWING \u2192 VERIFIED\n                                         \u2502\n                                    NEEDS_FIX \u2190 \u2500 \u2500 \u2500 \u2510\n                                         \u2502              \u2502\n                                    [fix attempt]       \u2502\n                                         \u2502              \u2502\n                                    re-VERIFY \u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 still fails?\n                                         \u2502\n                                    FAILED (after 3\u00d7) or SKIPPED\n```\n\n### Execution Order\n\n`get_ready_tasks()` returns only tasks where **all dependencies are VERIFIED**:\n\n```python\ndef get_ready_tasks(self) -> list[TaskNode]:\n    verified_ids = {t.id for t in self._task_dag if t.status == TaskStatus.VERIFIED}\n    return [\n        t for t in self._task_dag\n        if t.status == TaskStatus.PENDING\n        and all(dep in verified_ids for dep in t.depends_on)\n    ]\n```\n\n### Deadlock Detection\n\nIf no tasks are ready but some are pending (circular dependency or failed dependency), the engine detects the deadlock and skips blocked tasks.\n\n---\n\n## Structured Memory\n\n**The key innovation.** Instead of dumping the entire conversation into context (which wastes tokens on a 14B model), we slice information by role:\n\n### What Each Role Sees\n\n| Role | Receives | Does NOT receive |\n|------|----------|-----------------|\n| Coder | Architecture summary, file index, task description | Raw plan JSON, failure log, review history |\n| Reviewer | File content, architecture summary | Generation history, other files |\n| Analyzer | Error output, failure log (previous attempts) | Plan, other files |\n| Planner | Failure log, architecture summary | Individual file contents |\n\n### Memory Layers\n\n1. **architecture_summary** \u2014 one-paragraph description of the system\n2. **file_index** \u2014 every file and its one-line purpose\n3. **dependency_graph** \u2014 who imports whom\n4. **failure_log** \u2014 what broke, what was tried, what worked\n5. **task_nodes** \u2014 current DAG state with statuses\n\n### Why This Matters\n\nA 14B model with 16k context and **curated 2k of structured memory** outperforms a 70B model with 128k context and raw dumps. Signal-to-noise ratio is everything.\n\n---\n\n## Prompt Engineering\n\n### DeepSeek-R1 Think Tags\n\nDeepSeek-R1 outputs `<think>...</think>` blocks for chain-of-thought reasoning. We strip these before parsing JSON:\n\n```python\ndef _extract_json(text: str) -> dict:\n    # Remove <think> blocks\n    text = re.sub(r\"<think>.*?</think>\", \"\", text, flags=re.DOTALL)\n    # Find JSON in remaining text\n    match = re.search(r\"\\{.*\\}\", text, re.DOTALL)\n    return json.loads(match.group()) if match else {}\n```\n\n### JSON-Only Output\n\nAll roles that need structured output are prompted with explicit JSON schemas:\n\n```\nYou MUST respond with a JSON object:\n{\n  \"approved\": true/false,\n  \"issues\": [{\"severity\": \"critical|warning|info\", \"description\": \"...\"}],\n  \"summary\": \"...\"\n}\n```\n\n### Prompt Structure\n\nEach prompt follows this pattern:\n1. **Role identity** \u2014 \"You are a senior code reviewer...\"\n2. **Constraints** \u2014 \"Respond ONLY with JSON. No explanation.\"\n3. **Context injection** \u2014 Architecture summary, file index (sliced)\n4. **Task** \u2014 Specific instruction for this file/error\n5. **Output schema** \u2014 Exact JSON structure expected\n\n---\n\n## Verification Pipeline\n\nMulti-check quality gate per file (`executor.py`):\n\n### Checks by Language\n\n| Language | Syntax | Lint | Type Check |\n|----------|--------|------|-----------|\n| Python | `py_compile` | `ruff` \u2192 `flake8` fallback | extensible |\n| JavaScript | `node --check` | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n| JSON | `json.loads()` | \u2014 | \u2014 |\n\n### VerificationResult\n\n```python\n@dataclass\nclass VerificationResult:\n    passed: bool\n    checks: dict[str, tuple[bool, str]]  # check_name \u2192 (passed, detail)\n    \n    @property\n    def summary(self) -> str:\n        return \"\\n\".join(f\"{'\u2705' if ok else '\u274c'} {name}: {msg}\"\n                        for name, (ok, msg) in self.checks.items())\n    \n    @property\n    def failed_checks(self) -> list[str]:\n        return [name for name, (ok, _) in self.checks.items() if not ok]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Self-Correction & Failure Escalation\n\n### Fix Loop (Per Task)\n\n```\nAttempt 1: Analyzer diagnoses \u2192 Coder patches \u2192 Verify\nAttempt 2: Analyzer diagnoses (with attempt 1 in failure_log) \u2192 Coder patches \u2192 Verify\nAttempt 3: Analyzer diagnoses (with attempts 1-2 in failure_log) \u2192 Coder patches \u2192 Verify\n```\n\nThe failure_log prevents the Analyzer from suggesting the same fix twice.\n\n### Escalation (After 3 Failures)\n\nWhen a task exhausts all fix attempts, the engine offers 4 strategies:\n\n1. **Re-plan** \u2014 Send failure context back to Planner for an alternative approach\n2. **Simplify** \u2014 Regenerate with a simplified task description\n3. **Skip** \u2014 Mark as SKIPPED, continue with remaining tasks\n4. **Pause** \u2014 Ask the user what to do\n\nThe engine picks automatically based on context, or asks the user in interactive mode.\n\n---\n\n## CLI Architecture\n\n### Launch Flow\n\n```\njcode\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 First run? \u2192 Setup wizard (choose output dir)\n  \u251c\u2500\u2500 Check Ollama \u2192 fail fast if not running\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500 Interactive launcher:\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83c\udd95 Create new project\n      \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Enter prompt\n      \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 (Optional) clone GitHub repo as base\n      \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2192 Plan \u2192 Build pipeline\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udcc2 Continue a project (select from list)\n      \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 \u2192 Resume from last state\n      \u251c\u2500\u2500 \ud83d\udce5 Import a project\n      \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Local path\n      \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 GitHub URL \u2192 clone\n      \u2514\u2500\u2500 After build \u2192 REPL with commands\n```\n\n### Available Commands\n\n| Command | Module | Description |\n|---------|--------|-------------|\n| `build` | `cli.py` | Full pipeline |\n| `plan` | `cli.py` | Show current plan |\n| `files` | `cli.py` | List generated files |\n| `tree` | `file_manager.py` | Directory tree |\n| `projects` | `settings.py` | List saved projects |\n| `resume` | `cli.py` | Resume last project |\n| `update` | `cli.py` | Self-update JCode |\n| `save/load` | `context.py` | Session management |\n| `settings` | `settings.py` | Edit preferences |\n\n---\n\n## Module Reference\n\n| Module | Lines | Purpose |\n|--------|-------|---------|\n| `config.py` | ~190 | Models, TaskStatus, TaskNode, ProjectState, complexity detection |\n| `prompts.py` | ~200 | All 4 role system/task prompts with JSON schemas |\n| `ollama_client.py` | ~120 | Unified `call_model(role, msgs)`, streaming, model verification |\n| `context.py` | ~300 | Structured memory engine, DAG, session serialization |\n| `planner.py` | ~80 | `create_plan()`, `refine_plan()`, think-tag stripping |\n| `coder.py` | ~100 | `generate_file()`, `patch_file()`, fence stripping |\n| `reviewer.py` | ~60 | `review_file()` \u2192 JSON verdict |\n| `analyzer.py` | ~70 | `analyze_error()` \u2192 structured diagnosis |\n| `executor.py` | ~150 | `verify_file()`, multi-language checks |\n| `iteration.py` | ~240 | DAG orchestrator, fix loop, escalation |\n| `cli.py` | ~450 | Interactive CLI, launcher, all commands |\n| `settings.py` | ~120 | Persistent settings in `~/.jcode/` |\n| `file_manager.py` | ~90 | File I/O, Rich directory tree |\n\n---\n\n## Extending JCode\n\n### Adding a New Role\n\n1. Add model config in `config.py` (or reuse existing model)\n2. Create system + task prompts in `prompts.py`\n3. Create the role module (e.g., `tester.py`)\n4. Wire it into `iteration.py`'s pipeline\n5. Add conversation history in `context.py`\n\n### Adding a New Language Verifier\n\nIn `executor.py`, add a new case to `verify_file()`:\n\n```python\nelif suffix == \".rs\":\n    result = _verify_rust(file_path)\n```\n\nThen implement `_verify_rust()` following the pattern of `_verify_python()`.\n\n### Adding a New CLI Command\n\n1. Add the command handler as `_cmd_yourcommand()` in `cli.py`\n2. Add it to the dispatch block in `main()`\n3. Update `HELP_TEXT`\n\n### Custom Specialisation Templates\n\nCreate prompt templates for specific tech stacks:\n\n```python\nFASTAPI_TEMPLATE = {\n    \"tech_stack\": [\"python\", \"fastapi\", \"sqlalchemy\", \"pydantic\"],\n    \"files_hint\": [\"main.py\", \"models.py\", \"schemas.py\", \"database.py\", \"routers/\"],\n    \"conventions\": \"Use async endpoints.

      "docs/ANALYTICS.md": "# JCode Analytics Setup\n\nThis document explains the analytics infrastructure for tracking JCode installs.\n\n## Architecture\n\nThe install analytics system uses Vercel Edge Functions + Vercel KV (Redis) to track installations in real-time.\n\n### Endpoints\n\n- **`/install.sh`** \u2192 `/api/install.sh.js` \u2014 Tracks Unix/Linux/macOS installs\n- **`/install.ps1`** \u2192 `/api/install.ps1.js` \u2014 Tracks Windows installs\n- **`/api/stats`** \u2192 `/api/stats.js` \u2014 Analytics dashboard\n\n### Data Collected\n\nEach install logs:\n- **IP Address** (first in proxy chain)\n- **Timestamp** (ISO 8601)\n- **User-Agent** string\n- **OS** (inferred from User-Agent: macOS, Linux, Windows)\n- **Platform** (`unix` or `windows`)\n\n### Storage Schema (Vercel KV)\n\n```\njcode:install:count:unix      \u2192 Integer (total Unix installs)\njcode:install:count:windows   \u2192 Integer (total Windows installs)\njcode:installs                \u2192 List (last 1000 installs, JSON strings)\njcode:installs:YYYY-MM-DD     \u2192 Integer (daily install count, 90-day TTL)\n```\n\n## Vercel Setup\n\n### 1.

Click **Create & Continue**\n5. Connect to your project (select `getjcode.vercel.app`)\n\n### 2. Environment Variables\n\nVercel KV automatically injects these variables:\n- `KV_REST_API_URL`\n- `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`\n- `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`\n\nNo manual configuration needed \u2014 the `@vercel/kv` package uses them automatically.\n\n### 3. Deploy\n\n```bash\n# From the JcodeAgent repo root\ncd docs\nvercel --prod\n```\n\nThe `vercel.json` config ensures `/install.sh` and `/install.ps1` are rewritten to the API endpoints.\n\n## Testing Locally\n\nInstall Vercel CLI:\n```bash\nnpm i -g vercel\n```\n\nRun dev server:\n```bash\ncd docs\nvercel dev\n```\n\nVisit:\n- `http://localhost:3000/install.sh` \u2014 Should return the install script\n- `http://localhost:3000/api/stats` \u2014 Should show analytics dashboard\n\n## Dashboard\n\nVisit **`https://getjcode.vercel.app/api/stats`** to see:\n- Total installs (Unix + Windows)\n- Today's installs\n- OS distribution (macOS, Linux, Windows)\n- Last 20 installs with timestamps\n\n## Maintenance\n\n- **Data retention**: Last 1000 installs kept in `jcode:installs` list\n- **Daily stats**: Expire after 90 days\n- **KV limits**: Vercel free tier = 256MB storage, 10k requests/day (plenty for this use case)\n\n## Privacy\n\n- IPs are stored but not displayed publicly on the dashboard\n- No personally identifiable information beyond IP/UA\n- Data is used solely for install metrics\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf analytics fail (e.g., KV down), the install script still returns successfully \u2014 errors are logged but don't block installs.\n\nCheck Vercel logs:\n```bash\nvercel logs --prod\n```\n",

JCode auto-installs dependencies when needed.</li>\n        <li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> If something is unclear, ask JCode to explain. It has full context of your project.</li>\n        <li><strong>Trust the fix engine.</strong> If a file fails verification, JCode has 8 attempts with 5 different strategies. Let it work.</li>\n        <li><strong>Save your progress.</strong> Sessions auto-save. You can close JCode and resume later &mdash; your project and chat history are preserved.</li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>\n      <h3>Ollama not found</h3>\n      <p>Make sure Ollama is running: <code>ollama serve</code>.

JCode will ask again on next launch.</p>\n\n      <h3>Build keeps failing</h3>\n      <p>If the 8-attempt fix engine cannot resolve an issue, JCode will pause and ask for guidance.

Then just run `jcode`.\n\n### Manual Install\n\n```bash\n# 1. Clone / navigate to the project\ncd JcodeAgent\n\n# 2. Install\npip install -e .\n\n# 3. Start Ollama (in another terminal)\nollama serve\n\n# 4. Pull models (first time only)\nollama pull deepseek-r1:14b\nollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b\n\n# 5. Launch JCode\njcode\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n```\njcode> build a REST API with FastAPI that manages a todo list with SQLite\n```\n\nJCode will:\n1. Plan the architecture and create a dependency-ordered task DAG\n2. Generate each file with full architectural context\n3. Review each file for bugs before execution\n4. Run static analysis (syntax + lint)\n5. Auto-diagnose and patch any failures\n6. Output the complete verified project\n\n### Commands\n\n| Command | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `build <prompt>` | Full pipeline: plan \u2192 generate \u2192 review \u2192 verify \u2192 fix |\n| `plan` | Show current plan and task statuses |\n| `files` | List generated files with sizes |\n| `tree` | Show project directory tree |\n| `projects` | List all saved projects |\n| `resume` | Resume last project |\n| `save` | Manually save session |\n| `load <path>` | Load session from file |\n| `settings` | View/edit settings |\n| `clear` | Clear screen |\n| `help` | Show help |\n| `quit` | Exit JCode |\n\n## Architecture\n\n```\njcode/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py          # Package metadata (v0.2.0)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 __main__.py          # python -m jcode entry\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 cli.py               # Rich interactive CLI\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 config.py            # Models, TaskStatus, TaskNode, ProjectState\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 prompts.py           # All 4 role prompt templates\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 ollama_client.py     # Unified model caller with role dispatch\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 context.py           # Structured memory engine + DAG\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 planner.py           # Plan creation (DeepSeek-R1)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 coder.py             # File generation + patch mode\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 reviewer.py          # Pre-execution code review\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 analyzer.py          # Error diagnosis + fix strategy\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 executor.py          # Verification pipeline (syntax/lint/type)\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 iteration.py         # DAG-based orchestration engine\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 file_manager.py      # File I/O + Rich directory tree\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 settings.py          # Persistent user settings\n```\n\n## 4-Role System\n\n| Role | Model | Prompt Style | Purpose |\n|------|-------|-------------|---------|\n| \ud83e\udde0 Planner | `deepseek-r1:14b` | Architecture-focused | Task DAG, tech stack, dependency graph |\n| \ud83d\udcbb Coder | `qwen2.5-coder:14b` | Implementation-focused | File generation, targeted patches |\n| \ud83d\udd0d Reviewer | `qwen2.5-coder:14b` | Audit-focused | Pre-execution bug/security review |\n| \ud83d\udd2c Analyzer | `deepseek-r1:14b` | Diagnostic-focused | Root cause analysis, fix strategy |\n\nSame model weights, different system prompts = role specialisation without extra downloads.\n\n## Task Pipeline\n\n```\nFor each task in DAG order:\n\n  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n  \u2502 GENERATE \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502  REVIEW  \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502  VERIFY  \u2502\n  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u252c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                       \u2502                 \u2502\n                  issues?            passed?\n                       \u2502                 \u2502\n                  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510      \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                  \u2502  PATCH   \u2502      \u2502VERIFIED\u2502\n                  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518      \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n                       \u2502\n                       \u2502 still fails?\n                       \u2502\n                  \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25bc\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2510\n                  \u2502 ANALYZE  \u251c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u25ba\u2502  PATCH   \u251c\u2500\u2500\u25ba re-verify (up to 3\u00d7)\n                  \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518     \u2514\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2518\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\nSettings are stored in `~/.jcode/settings.json`:\n- Default output directory\n- Auto-save preference\n- Project metadata in `~/.jcode/projects/`\n\nSessions are auto-saved to `.jcode_session.json` in each project directory and can be resumed with `resume`.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
